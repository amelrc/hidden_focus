        1985. For the next decade plus, he helped sharpen my photographic eye,
        rifling together through the semi annual Christie’s and Sotheby’s auction
        catalogues, and introducing me to the work of (among others) Louis Faurer,
        Aaron Siskind, Lewis Hine, Richard Misrach, and Margaret Watkins. Over the
        years, Bob has sunk deep roots in the classical photography market, while

			Montreal was a prominent stop on my semi annual research marketing tours
			for RBC. Over the years, I had noted and enjoyed Robert’s cover photos for
			Fugues magazine, but we had never met. The opportunity came in 2003 when
			Lawrence needed something special for his business card. When we met for
			the shoot, I was impressed by Robert’s professionalism and no nonsense
			approach to the work. Equally, though, I was taken with his warmth and
			power to connect, qualities that since the early 1980’s had supported his
			role as a major player in the emergence of gay culture in Montreal.
      </p>
		<p>
			On subsequent visits I would look forward to catching up with him over
			dinner, excited for the chance to show him a few shots from my most recent
			travels. His observations were always supportive, measured and on point.
      </p>
		<p>
			Sitting in Robert’s living room, I could feel from his images around me
			the ironic stare of Diane Arbus, the streetwise capture of Robert Frank,
			the canine playfulness of William Wegman, the erotic thrust and elegance
			of Robert Mapplethorpe. But no lame stylistic imitations here. Just pure
			Robert, and his unique vision of our shared humanity. Salut, Robert!

			My Ariadne. In the summer of 20XX, Dorothy conducted a vocal masterclass

			many years with bel canto master Cornelius L. Reid, and internalized the
			fundamental principles he articulated in The Free Voice: A Guide to
			Natural Singing. What I heard and saw that day at masterclass convinced me
			that if ever I was to deliver a song the way I felt it should be sung,
			Dorothy was the one to enable it. And so it has been!

			by surprise saying 'You know, you really should step up and buy a good
			camera... the kind of shots you’re getting would look great in larger
			formats, but what you’re shooting now just can’t handle that.' So, with
			his help, I got my first Canon 5D at New Years 2010, just before heading
        off on a trip to Cuba.{" "}

			Michelle, a mother of twin teenage daughters, wedding planner, home
			renovator and skilled graphic artist, spent a disproportionate part of her
			youth touring museums and galleries across North America and abroad.
      </p>
		<p>
			We became friends in June 2018 when Lawrence and I prepared to move out of
			Toronto’s downtown core to the wilds of Scarborough. For a gruelling week,
			Michelle and I worked day and night sprucing up the new place just prior
			to the move. We talked a lot about art, and I promised to show her some of
			my pictures after settling in.
      </p>
		<p>
			So, one day last Spring, after touring my photo world of Cuba, Cape Cod,
			New York and Paris, and seeing the earliest of the “Look at the Flowers”
			images, she remarked: “This is most unusual. Your eye for composition and
			use of so many different styles is something I have never seen. I’m blown
			away... But you’ve got to print these in larger formats, much larger. You
			think you know what’s in the frames because you took them. But I’m telling
			you, even you won’t really be able to appreciate what you’ve got until you
			see them bigger.”
      </p>
		<p>
			As she put on her coat that day to leave, she turned to me with a kind but
			troubled look and said: “As much as I love your pictures, I must tell you
			something that will come as a surprise. I’m really angry right now. Angry
			that your work has been hidden away for so long in little boxes. They must
			be shown! You must find a way to do that. I will help any way I can.”
      </p>

			Deepest thanks, Michelle, for pushing my little boxes out of the nest!
